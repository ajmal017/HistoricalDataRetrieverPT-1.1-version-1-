ViceroyOn September 14, Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal all reported that the US Department of Justice joined the SEC in the investigation related to potential securities fraud. On September 20, 2020, Milton resigned as Executive Chairman of Nikola Motors departed the company effective immediately.
12:12 AM
ViceroyNKLA His executives agree to a $1 annual salary each and Milton STILL screws them over! He's just made a ton of enemies!

AleksanderJSIUWhat? Was I off?
07:44 AM
SIUAleksanderJthis deal is funny, and it's old, it's more relevant to look up the Hindenburg report, sorry for being cryptic.
07:45 AM
SIUthe deal is like, GM agrees to let NKLA sell them stuff, after NKLA pays them a lot of money, it's weird. It's like Kevin O Leary on Cameo just endorsing anyone that pays him 1200 bucks, what it reminds me of.
07:46 AM
AleksanderJSIUAhh, I see. The hundenburg report is the reason for the short, but Tim asked why it was up 9/8
07:46 AM

07:36 AM
sgoodall31use news scanner on STT. I got alerted when the stock was at 2.12
07:36 AM
Jputnam13Benzinga?
07:37 AM
Kooper59I know Lento links people to "Scanz"
07:37 AM
Jputnam13Benzinga isn't bad. I have heard scanz is great
07:37 AM
Kooper59sgoodall31that was a quick alert. i had a chance at 2.40 but read the news while it went to $2.80
07:38 AM
Jputnam13Scanz also costs more money as well.
07:38 AM
Kooper59STT is kinda pricey but I'm hoping to get it once I'm able to upgrade my computer
07:39 AM
Kooper59Jputnam13i understand. I think it's substantially cheaper but that's not the issue. My machines won't run STT. Our house is tore to hell presently because of lazy ass contractors. once the office is back together i can start thinking of building a nice new PC

07:41 AM
Kooper59it's ok. most of the vids are about shorting though. i need to find more vids about indicators and how to use them. i usually just gut my trades which is not working very well. i have more guts than brains at this point.
07:42 AM
Jputnam13I dodge not buying highs and only buying dips. Unless the news is like an FDA approved notice of some sort.
07:43 AM
IvanPsgoodall31can I ask, how do you set an alert on news scan? I have one news scan on penny stock with 5%+ change in price and 1000+volume, but I'm not watching it all the time, an alert would be v. helpful (I can see the VTVT news there, but I wasn't alerted)
07:43 AM
Kooper59i can crash whole indices. all i have to do is buy an index etf and down she goes.

Kooper59$MNOV is off to the races.
07:47 AM
Kooper59I haven't tried ToS on my phone yet. I used Fidelity Active Trader Pro since they have all my money. I use ATP for making trades and ToS for everything else
07:50 AM
Kooper59i keep reading that $MNOV news and I don't see it justifying this price increase
07:51 AM
Kooper59it's a preclinical in mice.
07:55 AM
ChevonKooper59in my opinion (which may not count for much). I think that because the markets have slowed down somewhat people will pile into tickers with irrelevant news
07:55 AM
Chevonhence all the initial intrest in $MNOV OR people "believe in the medicine"
07:56 AM
MaerskKooper59MNOV is just another POS with a BS covid19 headline.ive said many times massive pharmas like GILD ABT PFE dont have a cure so how the hell will this POS (8 employess....)have one.just trade the hype.........
07:56 AM
Kooper59Chevoni really wanted to go in but missed my $6.90 entry. then it got a little choppy. i'm not chasing entries any more.
07:58 AM
Kooper59shits probably gonna take off at 9
07:59 AM
TimLentoMICE?
08:00 AM
ChevonTimLento...mice
08:00 AM

ChevonKooper59Yeah chasing entries tends to lose me more money than bad planning. I find that if you study, and enter every trade with a plan your losses get cut into 1/3 rather than if you chase.
08:01 AM

08:05 AM
GiorgioMarinowhat type of indicators are you rlooking for!?
08:05 AM
Kooper59GiorgioMarinouhh ones that will help me plan entries and exits
08:06 AM
Kooper59i see people talking sometimes about "ema"
08:07 AM
GiorgioMarinobreak outs and breakdowns usually a good point to start... moving averages can help you find also areas where the price could bounce from
08:07 AM
Kooper59i've also seen people speak of "MACD" in here
08:07 AM
GiorgioMarinoor if it breaks important areas it could be a signal for a buy ect
08:08 AM
GiorgioMarinoi think all these thingsa re useful for longer trend plays.. not sure if shortterm 1-2 hour trades these are so relevant..
08:08 AM
GiorgioMarinoi do not use them
08:08 AM
Kooper59GiorgioMarinothank you for your consideration and response!
08:08 AM
GiorgioMarinoi think this type of TA is more relevant in Forex/Crypto.. not sure about penny stocks
08:08 AM
Simkovichim in $MNOV premarket at 6.29, we think this qill spike into market open?
08:10 AM
RichardofyorkeNMTR good spike
08:10 AM
GiorgioMarinobut... a lot of these indicators are like self fulfilling prophecies.. if you look at BTC/USD .. people always play the fibonacci retracements ect.. and these levels always get hit one way or the other.. my 2 cents... but not an expert by any means..

jdm241993What's some good advice anyone can give me besides cut loses quickly. I have a small account and I was doing ok I started at 300 and I got it up $26 but now I'm down to $312 like ik that's not alot. But for a small account seeing ur account lose money is extremely frustrating.
04:54 AM

04:56 AM
tycoon448jdm241993Save at least 2000 bucks, then start trading. 300 is nothing. You will always be down.

jdm241993Stock_SurferLike I see price action but I always wait to late to buy in.
04:58 AM
jdm241993tycoon448That makes sense. I was just thinking about that to because the less you can out in the longer u try to stay in and be more risky bc the gain isn't much

mtgAnybody has tips for trading halted stocks? do they usually gap in the other direction after the halt?
05:07 AM
jdm241993So like NAOV on 9/22 I was in 180 shares at 9:58 held on to it until 10:03. 1.23 to 1.16. I actually had a $5 gain but wasn't sure what it was gonna do so I kept holding and it dropped.
05:08 AM
jdm241993I think bc my position was so small is what messed me up because had I had a bigger position I would've had a bigger quicker gain and would've been better off. I think

JRodAR83Well everytime I have tried buying a dip on 2nd GD they just keep dipping and I have wrecked 66% of my account this month
07:40 AM

07:40 AM
RelentlesStormOnly dip buy multi-day runners
07:40 AM
HMstarsJRodAR83tell me about it... but this energy sector is a bit hot right now which is different but late for my 0 account
07:41 AM
JRodAR83I have done the boot camp 3x. Plus 100s of hours of tims courses but i am missing something on when to dip buy.
07:41 AM
HMstarsSUNW cant seem to go below $4.75
07:41 AM
JRodAR83Maybe level 2's is how you guys are so successful at it?\
07:42 AM
SergopikovSUNW just make no sense its gonna drop soon , but $JE is a good opportunity holding the VWAP right now .
07:42 AM
SergopikovMy thoughts
07:42 AM
InkedMikeJRodAR83Well you have to be ready to react this morning that's for sure. I'm thinking that They might do some crazyness this morning but the LONG is what I'm thinking. Get it early cheap this morning and hold it through the day or until it takes a turn.

08:23 AM
InkedMikeJebus1998Remember, these are pennystocks, no one cares about them. They take time to have movement. That's what gives us an edge. We can get in early and hold, as long as we watch it run up and sell then we win. We don't have to get in the day it runs up, it just helps. I'm learning patience. Had I had some yesterday, I would have doubled my investment account on SPI but I wasn't patient.

jconciWas in and out CBAT at around the $3s before it broke to $4. Looks like its going on a plummet and down trending. Volume is up at 14 million (an hour ago around 10 million). I would hold off. Spiraling downtrend. Cut losses quickly!

costam911to think, i thpought i nailed CBAT at $1.61 yesterday
08:27 AM
IvanPLpena1214because one learns this only on his own mistakes :) and this was one of my very first trades. Also, my first buy was at 6.08, while it was spiking back then (5th May), then with couple of dip buys I brought down the average to 3.22 and when it kept dropping, I stopped adding to my position and submitted a GTC order for 3.28 and was just waiting. Maybe I should have put some alerts in place and could have sold it for more, but at least I have a profit. Lessons learned. It feels good to get rid of

Kooper59SparkTradezi'm watching videos like mad. i usually leave the chat when the market opens. maybe that's my mistake. i hope to catch on like you obviously have. i've started trading less and smaller positions.
08:43 AM
gpkendrickKooper59I have done a lot of that, and still do sometimes. Patience and Discipline. Wait till the stock proves itself. Now I try to only buy rising strong with strong volume. Jump in while it's flying up. Stop guessing. No more dip buys unless big panic on multiday runner.
08:43 AM
SparkTradezI started with 100 share positions or maybe 50 shares.
08:44 AM
AidenBeckdanDo you have any thoughts on $SGBX?
08:44 AM
SparkTradezNow I am usually opening a position with 1000 and buying into the move in 500 increments.
08:44 AM
BeckdanAidenI'd love to short, but it is kind of flat right now. Waiting on it to either make a big move up or down to make a decision. 50/50 right now.
08:45 AM
gpkendrickChevonyes, it needs to prove itself. You never know what effect news will have. Look at SPI
08:45 AM
Kooper59SparkTradezyou give me hope. i've just been trading to big and too often. i need patience and discipline like Kendo said. The funny thing about losing is you get mad and want it back. Then you just lose more.

BeckdanCBAT killing shorts right now. I was very short biased afterhours yesterday, but with it holding up this morning, I am certain there are a lot of short trapped now. Shares are HTB today. I could get some early, but didn't and now I regret it. None available now. Probably just a watch for me since I can't get shares, but I will keep trying.
08:58 AM

12:02 AM
noshbariaibuffYep... perfectly mentioned
12:04 AM
ibuffafter pouring through all the dvd's and webinars i think a great idea is to find a trade buddy, someone you can bounce your picks off of
12:07 AM
noshbariaibuffI won't mind sharing my market list but please note I am on the learning curve myself so thread carefully please... Private messaging you...
12:07 AM
ibuffthats what is great about this portal, you are never alone, you can throw out your questions if you ever have a doubt
12:08 AM
Edw1nibuffyeah that's true

ibuffi went from being an institutional investor to buying what is moving at that single minute, its a crazy game

Gerg40517GM all, lots of studying this weekend, lets see how much i screw up today lol
04:33 AM
thinkeGM, hopefully not too much
04:34 AM
Gerg40517its stubborn habits that get me and i know it, that's the rough part lol
04:36 AM
thinkeYeah me too, patience, chasing, fomoing
04:39 AM
Gerg40517your not alone!
04:39 AM
AleksanderJGM. Excactly the same happening here. Bad entries and exits on good potential trades. And I ALWAYS know what I did wrong after the fact
04:40 AM
JRodAR83Same! Why are we so stubborn.... LOL
04:41 AM
Gerg40517hindsight is 20/20, That's why i am committing to posting it all and hopefully learning from those mistakes
04:41 AM
IvanPGerg40517just trade very carefully :) I somehow managed not to blow up my account in the first months of trading, so I think anybody can manage, too. The key is to experiment with small amounts and not to rise your bets until you are certain of what you're doing and your profits are consistent :) I know, that's a nice theory. We just need to practice and watch
04:42 AM
Gerg40517increase the knowledge account, i have to look at that as a profit in itself.
04:43 AM
AleksanderJYeah, trading carefully is key. I personally trade with 1/6 of 1% on each trade. So it will take time to blow up :)
04:44 AM
IvanPas I watched other bleed because the were increasing their bets after losing couple of trades, I did the opposite: whenever I lost, I decreased the bets. After couple of wins, I increased them. The easy key is, never bet more than 5% of your account. If you're winning, account is growing, and 5% of your account is also growing - so you can bet more. And vice versa
04:45 AM
JRodAR83Down to 700 out of 5k and starting to finally understand and now its hard to make $$ with so little and the $10 fee for the trades..
04:47 AM
AleksanderJYeah, that's the problem for most. When you finally learn to trade, the account is almost gone. That's the problem with going in with size in the beginning
04:49 AM
Gerg40517Thankful for this chat and the lessons, it has me only going roughly .05% of my account on any trade, cutting my losses(most of the time, still have that "oh it will bounce mentality at times) and went from thinking i was a knowledgeable investor with stash to realizing i didn't know shit!!!

07:27 AM
Kooper59Tbone18that's why i haven't gotten it. my current pc's won't support it
07:27 AM
IvanPTbone18I sent a question to STT support, and they only told me, that some sources calculate float and some use SEC fillings and that STT uses SEC fillings. But, I showed them an example, where STT showed a different number that IB, finviz, yahoo and marketwatch at the same time (and these 4 showed the same number). So ...
07:28 AM

I see it there, but I'm not watching that small window all the time ... why the hell there is no alerting there (a sound). There is only alert in Top% gainers, when there is a new headline on a ticker in the list, but MDGS wasn't in the list, yet, so no alert. omg

Travis_RiosTimLentoWould it be fair to say that a midday gapper should be treated somewhat like a premarket gapper, and that golden hour is similar to market open in its behavior toward these gappers (Such as $SURF spiking at 11:30 and then running around 2pm yesterday)? Sorry for maybe a dumb question, but I tend to learn better through comparison/analogy....

OCNYDayTradingTimLentodo you know how to set up a multi-factor alert in ToS, or if it is even possible? e.g. price > x and volume index > y
08:39 AM
OCNYDayTradingINFINITYyeah, it hit $3.05'ish then retraced back down to $2.5-$2.6 in the next 3-5 minutes. will need to break through $3 more convincingly if it is going to have a chance to breakout
08:41 AM
OCNYDayTradingINFINITYat $2.4-$2.5, it may be a decent entry. but it is still risky given it's half way between the 52 week low and key resistance level

IvanPSPI news: strategic agreement: https://api.quotemedia.com/supplement/news-story/?webmasterId=102132&storyId=8378175265796104
04:40 AM
thinkeSPI low volume
04:40 AM
IvanPyes, but wait for 7am, 8am, 9am. It could be a runner again
04:41 AM
IvanPit spiked from 7.50 to 10 on low volume, let's see what it does with the high volume :)
04:43 AM
thinkeIvanPyou r the true, pm moderator, so buy the dip ?, news is fluffy, but it's an former runner
04:47 AM
IvanPI'm not :) I'm just learning, I'm only saying my opinions, you can correct me if I'm wrong. But SPI was a supernova spiker recently on similar news, so there are good odds it can spike again. But it does not have to, it's just a theory. Remember what Tim says - we need to react to what's happening. And never try to predict. Hence, I'd wait for the volume and price action (7am, 8am, 9am). If it doesn't spike, fuck it :)
04:48 AM
IvanPAnd I'm so early here only because I'm in London - 4am eastern equals 9am GMT :)
04:50 AM
IvanPand I like pre-market spikers, because it's not so fast as at market hours and it usually does not drop so fast - you have time to react (cut loses quickly). I've already made 1 trade this morning and I made a small profit even after making a mistake and buying for ASK (1.47) instead of buying for BID (1.37) - wrong button :D It still spiked a little, slowly, then it slowly fade out, so there was plenty of time to sell.
04:51 AM
AleksanderJYou traded $STAF ?
04:51 AM
IvanPbut I traded wrong ticker (KNIX), should have traded STAF, it spiked more
04:51 AM
IvanPunfortunately not :)
04:52 AM
AleksanderJI was looking at it before it spiked, but since I didn't see any catalyst, I thought it would spike and fail
04:52 AM
IvanPbut I made a note, that after hours spikers that end strong, could spike at 4am again. I will be watching them now
04:52 AM
AleksanderJaha, nice to notice
04:52 AM
IvanPSTAF or KNIX?
04:53 AM
AleksanderJSTAF
04:54 AM
IvanPsome people that miss the first spike, trade it the next day. or maybe there's a pattern that people follow (as I said before, after hours spiker that ends strong, spiking in the morning) and they follow it. Or maybe, few people started trading it, caused the small gap up and then bots were triggered and bought it too. Hard to say
04:54 AM
thinkeyeah momentum is kept through the night
04:55 AM
IvanPbut it happens, spikes without a current catalyst, it's hart to explain
04:55 AM
IvanP*hard

thinkeSPI moving
04:57 AM
thinketoo low volume yet
04:57 AM
IvanPyes, looks like it bounced from 8.5, but I'd wait for volume
04:59 AM
IvanP7.2 looks to be this week's support, so it sounds like a reasonable risk given the positive news and hot sector. Just thinking loud ...
05:01 AM
thinkebig resistance round 9 $ could break this easy with volume
05:03 AM
IvanPJG news, 17.24M funding
05:04 AM
IvanPthinkevery nice, you must have been quick
05:07 AM
thinkeIvanPWhere do you get this news so fast STT?
05:08 AM
IvanPSTT news scanner - just click on the eye, then custom news scan, create new and then filter what you're interested in, like price below 15, volume 1000, %change 1 or so.
05:08 AM
IvanPBut I'm considering getting some other news source too (TOS or Benzinga)
05:10 AM
IvanPThe problem is (and I can't get it), there is no alert on this news scanner .... why anyone implements a news scanner without and alert? But, you can set up alert in Top%gainers window on a Headline. So if any of the ticker in top % gainers got news, you're alerted. Problem is, the window is empty in the morning and you want to be alerted before the stock spikes, when the news got out ...

Kooper59good morning folks
06:22 AM
Kooper59IvanPTim Lento always links "Scanz"
06:23 AM
Kooper59https://scanz.com/pricing/
06:23 AM
IvanPYes, scanz, TOS, equityfeed, benzinga are the most common (news and scanners)
06:24 AM
Kooper59i haven't looked in to it. we have our house tore to hell. contractors are giving us grief. once that's finished i plan to get a new computer and get set up properly. right now i'm using an i3 lappy connected to my 60" tv
06:25 AM
Kooper59i use fidelity ATP and ToS and my machine bogs. it croaked in the middle of a trade the other day but fortunately i escaped with a small profit.
06:25 AM
IvanPI think benzinga is 99/mo, the basic one, not sure if both news and scanners are included, but news definitely
06:25 AM
IvanPah, so you're saying, another news feed will eat your laptop resources?
06:26 AM
Kooper59i'm pretty sure it would. i keep getting out of memory errors on ToS
06:26 AM
Kooper59i need to build a good machine and buy a few proper monitors. then i was planning to get STT.
06:27 AM
Kooper59i'm considering joining @evolvedtrader's program
06:27 AM
Kooper59i think it's a little slower moving and less pressure
06:27 AM
Kooper59i ate it hard yesterday on MDRR
06:28 AM
Kooper59i was sizing up on that second run up. was in for about 2000 shares at one point and it dropped over a dollar in a minute. it was dropping so fast i couldn't catch it until i was in the red for $800
06:28 AM
IvanPnow how do I decide between scanz and benzinga? :)
06:28 AM
IvanPyeah me too, MDRR's a bitch
06:29 AM
Kooper59there was good strength and volume going up and i don't see how anyone could have predicted a million shares sold all at once.
06:29 AM
Kooper59it must have been a programmed trade or something. i thought i was following the rules.
06:29 AM
IvanPyou can't predict that. Couple of days ago, Tim was also caught on a big drop
06:30 AM
Kooper59where you from Ivan?
06:30 AM
IvanPI know Tim doesn't like it (and doesn't use it), but I'm considering to start using stop losses. I think his arguments don't hold any more, there are pretty smart algorithms there and if you set it up right, it will definitely be executed
06:31 AM
IvanPI'm in London (living and working), but I'm from Slovakia
06:31 AM
Kooper59i really need to learn more. i'd like to have hotkeys to sell.
06:31 AM
Kooper59i love fidelity and Active Trader Pro but the way i'm doing it seems a little clunky
06:31 AM
IvanPthat's what I'm considering too :) Again, Tim's argument against hotkeys is overtrading
06:32 AM
Kooper59the drop yesterday was too fast. a hotkey may have saved me but maybe not. it was sooo fast it looked like a late print
06:33 AM
Kooper59we visited the czech republic two years ago
06:33 AM
IvanPhow much was it percentwise for you? I lost 10% on that trade
06:33 AM
IvanPbut it's also because I tried to add on dip buy and it kept falling. I should have sold and then wait for the dip
06:34 AM
Kooper59i don't even know.
06:34 AM
IvanPone candle (1m) usually does not drop more than 5%-10%, so you should have enough time, but I think you need to sell for MIDPRICE to get executed
06:34 AM
Kooper59about 10%
06:35 AM
Kooper59i was four cents from an exitt
06:35 AM
IvanPI put all my trades in excel and one of the column is % PnL before and after commissions
06:35 AM
Kooper59i was going to exit at 4.80
06:35 AM
Kooper59i'm old
06:35 AM
IvanPsometimes %PnL is a profit before commissions and a loss after, scalping is not profitable :)
06:35 AM
Kooper59i don't know how to use excel
06:35 AM
Kooper59i'm also a hardware guy
06:36 AM
Kooper59we visited england on the same trip but didn't go to london

Kooper59we used to play Worms2 together back in the day
06:37 AM
Kooper59im 61 years old
06:37 AM
IvanPthere's a cheap course on Excel on Udemy, it's worth it. But you can save your trades to profit.ly, it will calculate PnL for you
06:37 AM
Kooper59i'm embarrassed to put my trades there
06:37 AM
IvanPit's never too late to learn something :)
06:37 AM
Kooper59(doh)
06:38 AM
IvanPI think you don't need to share them (I think there is an option to keep them private; maybe I'm wrong)
06:38 AM
Kooper59i see
06:38 AM
AleksanderJ61 years old. If you can get a hang of this, then at least you have some income after retirement, unlike most people. I'm 33 and I expect the pension fund to be gone by the time I retire
06:38 AM
Kooper59i'm not a very regimented person. i don't keep logs other than what ATP has. it lists all my closed positions.
06:39 AM
Kooper59i'm disabled but haven't tried to apply yet. our government sucks donkey dicks big time. i actually expect the shit to hit the fan and violent revolution.
06:39 AM
StudyingUpSoSheCanStayHomeBe careful with SPI. It’s still up so much when you think about it. It was in the 1s before the 3rd week in September when it then went supernova.
06:40 AM
Kooper59i think the dollar will collapse completely because the fed just keeps creating them out of thin air.
06:40 AM
Kooper59i have some precious metal. gold, silver, brass, lead.
06:40 AM

Shanky7$STAF cracked 20c in the last 3 mins
07:16 AM
IvanPjamesriverajrnote the 7 indicators Tim recommends to watch. For me, definitely the catalyst (strong/weak), chart history (does is spike and drops, or does it keep strong for some time and respike?), risk/reward - stocks already 200% up are risky (can suddenly drop, see MDRR yesterday), volume (very important, it's best to trade top 10 day-volume stocks), price action - dip buying? catching the spike?
07:16 AM
IvanPand also the overall market (index indicators like SPY, DIA, QQQ)
07:17 AM
IvanPThat's pretty much the basics, I would say
07:18 AM

BeckdanSharkEsqTwo comments on shorting. Don't get stubborn or you will blow up fast and I think it is easier than longing if you control your risk and your emotions (not easy).

06:56 AM
DTS86lol, well i start at 4am eastern with the rest of em
06:57 AM
INFINITYIvanPAt least by what I've seen. Do you like IB?
06:58 AM
IvanPhave you tried investopedia? https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premarket.asp "Several direct-access brokers allow access to pre-market trading to commence as early at 4:00 a.m. EST from Monday through Friday."
06:58 AM
INFINITYIvanPI wonder if etrade will allow if requested.
06:59 AM
IvanPI like IB in a way ... a can imagine a better way of placing orders. For last couple of days I screw up couple of orders because of this GUI. Still trying to find a faster and more reliable way to place orders
06:59 AM
RickyWhiteEtrade starts at 7am.. Only broker I know that starts before is WeBull starts at 4am
06:59 AM
louiedecaro31thinkeDoes double top mean as much pre market when the volume hasn't reached full potential? just curious on peoples thoughts with that?
06:59 AM
IvanPYes, I think Etrade does not allow 4am trading ..., but there are more brokers than IB that allow it
07:01 AM
C_ShellGood Morning people
07:01 AM
INFINITYIvanPMy current settings allow 7am. I will have to call them. I'm up early anyway, and so much activity in the pre-market these days. Used to be, PR's come out at 9ish, now pre-market is the new playing feild.

MichaelGoode$HTZ on the margin this is beneficial to the company to get a DIP loan but it isn't surprising -- DIP loans are superior to all existing loans and are very low risk to the lenders. This does on net increase the company's indebtedness which will make it less likely for shareholders to get anything at the end of bankruptcy

MichaelGoode$NAV +20% $42.65 $4.1 billion mkt cap Traton close to acquiring Navistar for $44.50 per share, CNBC reports -- Volkswagen's (VWAGY) Traton and Navistar (NAV) are very close to a deal for Traton to acquire what it does not own of the Navistar for $44.50 per share, CNBC's David Faber report, citing people close to the negotiations. Carl Icahn and Mark Rachesky are supporting deal, which still needs formal approval, but has been agreed to verbally, Faber adds.
09:13 AM
MichaelGoode$NAV of course best to ignore it because it is a buyout
09:14 AM
NotaRussianSpyBeckdanAh, well i can only recommend acquiring a long perspective on $HTZ, if only to aid you in finding a better shorting opportunity. As I am doing the reverse for going long :)
