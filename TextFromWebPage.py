07:11 AM
OmeI haven‚Äôt seen any news on KXIN . It just seems to go crazy every day.
07:12 AM
PatrickRobertsongpkendrickyeah its just weird is it a chatroom pump or a twitter pump possibly
07:12 AM
OmeI‚Äôve made a lot of money on it daily
07:12 AM
gpkendrickKXIN - I made a quick $310, news or no news :)
07:13 AM
STOCK_HUSTLEgpkendricknice
07:13 AM
PatrickRobertsongpkendrickyeah u cant deny the volume and price action on it right now wish i saw it earlier if there is more volume like this might be worth looking for a morning spike on open
07:14 AM
Kooper59good morning!
07:14 AM
gpkendrickAIHS trying to make a move now
07:14 AM
Kooper59gpkendricki got up a little late and wasn't ready
07:15 AM
Kooper59my charts on ToS are lagging actual prices. I really need to get a faster machine.
07:15 AM
PatrickRobertsonanyone looking at $VYST today looks like a great set up
07:17 AM
gpkendrickKooper59Early Bird gets the worm Ha Ha!
07:18 AM
Kooper59gpkendrickindeed. i still think the best action is right at 7. i'd really like to be ready for that and be off by 1030 or 11
07:18 AM
Dirkjohnson$CVS on the move with news, HIRING THOUSANDS in anticipation of coronavirus vaccine distributions
07:19 AM
Kooper59i didn't plan to get on today. i get these shot that keep my lungs from swelling and choking me out but the pharmacy keeps delaying the shipments so i'm a week late. i have to go get them at 830. it sucks being dependent on meds to breathe
07:20 AM
STOCK_HUSTLEDirkjohnsonIt's going to take a lot to move a 1.30 billion dollar float on $cvs
07:20 AM
reverselongKooper59did u get covid?
07:21 AM
Kooper59reverselongno. i have severe persistent asthma and copd. i've less than 20% of my effective lung volume.
07:22 AM
Kooper59that's what keeps me from signing up for the MC. almost 7 grand for that and another 2.5 for STT. i may not live long enough to take advantage of the education.
07:22 AM

STOCK_HUSTLEDirkjohnsonOh, ok. GL
07:24 AM
Kooper59gpkendricki signed on to see KXIN and NNDM spiking. Almost entered KXIN at 2.77 but i've been losing my ass chasing trades and making hasty decisions. i was down almost 2k last week all from breaking rules.
07:25 AM
froggy2371Hey, did anyone also not receive Tim's alert new watchlist today?
07:25 AM
Kooper59froggy2371i didn't
07:25 AM

07:26 AM
DrewMattno I didnt either
07:26 AM
Shanky7KXIN might break pre market high
07:26 AM
froggy2371Ok, maybe there is something wrong on thier end.
07:26 AM
MrMierrorphantyeah still waiting as well, was just about to ask thanks!
07:26 AM
kobrakaiwhew nice momentum $HTZ
07:26 AM
ajb997Shanky7If it holds above 4.1 i'll try long
07:27 AM
Kooper59NNDM and KXIN. amazing price action with no apparent news.
07:27 AM
Shanky7$KXIn in at 3.67 out at 4 100s
07:27 AM
Kooper59NNDM has been skyrocketing for days.
07:28 AM
gpkendrick$HTZ is still going up too
07:29 AM
amsbeatsGoood morning fellow pandemic traders! Let's get in this week.
07:29 AM
ajb997I got burned for $400 on Friday by $HTZ. Too cautious too touch it again
07:30 AM
AM3good morning guys! hope everyone has a great day
07:30 AM
amsbeatsHad a really crap week last week so I put a max loss on my account and I"m on probation. Really shit market conditions so I gotta play damage control until things change.
07:30 AM
AM3ajb997same
07:30 AM
amsbeatsBut we're getting into Winter soon here so I'm optimistic about a turn around sometime soon! It was inevitable for a cool off period after all the covid hype
07:32 AM
JRodAR83Want to see KXIN break strong through 4
07:37 AM
AM3has anyone bought anything premarket
07:37 AM
gpkendrickKooper59Stop breaking the rules, you'll do better, I promise.
07:38 AM
CkrisJRodAR83instead waiting you could already make 50%, lol!!
07:39 AM
Kooper59gpkendrickyou're inspiring me with your green days brother.
07:39 AM
kobrakai$HTZ at fridays high
07:40 AM
kobrakaiits gonna breakout
07:40 AM
STOCK_HUSTLE$HTZ broke the high from friday of $2.86
07:40 AM
gpkendrickKooper59I'm up $380 this AM. Lost $60 on stupid AIHS fakeout
07:41 AM
gpkendrickKooper59Wait for Green and Rising with volume - get in, get out, take the $$$
07:41 AM
PatrickRobertson$HTZ good volume for market open
07:41 AM
Kooper59gpkendricki was up 200 on some stock last week and it kept going. i kept my cool until i didn't then i chased it and ended up -800
07:41 AM
Stroe217I don't see a lot of potential for $HTZ @ 1 year it doesn't look like a former runner or even a one and done
07:42 AM
kobrakaivery nice $HTZ, well done. -100 on my short
07:42 AM
Stroe217Does nay one else see somthign I dont' for $HTZ other the the SEC fillings and news?
07:42 AM
gpkendrickKooper59Not what you THINK is going - what IS going up. There's a big difference
07:42 AM
DRourke$htz at 3
07:43 AM
Kooper59gpkendrickbelieve it or not i'm getting better. FOMO still grabs me by the short hairs and swings me around though. I lost a ton in march and moved to cash and sat on the sidelines while the market had it's best 100 days in history. it's that lost money that keeps eating at me. i want it BACK!
07:43 AM
PatrickRobertsoni want it to dip before the open $HTZ and break the PM high would be ideal for me
07:43 AM
gpkendrickKooper59CCNC flying
07:44 AM
amsbeatsOBLG pretty much a perfect double top on Friday. High probability of FRD would consider shorting a spike or bounce
07:44 AM
gpkendrickCNCC Flying
07:44 AM
amsbeatsif it gaps down then retrouches 4.09 or close to it that would be ideal.
07:44 AM
amsbeatsCCNC absolutely FLYING crazy
07:45 AM

Kooper59and the rich get richer
07:47 AM
ajb997Boiler room vibes
07:48 AM
ajb997CCNC just dropped 100%. That hurts the soul

07:50 AM

07:50 AM
Kooper59PeterValenciathx
07:50 AM
andyin250drkpleasureno news.
07:51 AM
PatrickRobertsoni dont trust CCNC too much spread like 10- 15 cents be careful
07:51 AM
amsbeats$HTZ flat top break out, and about to retest 2.71 break level
07:52 AM
kissumssooo spready CCNC..
07:52 AM
Kooper59benjamins2wif you've not money for programs you may want to try Think or Swim from TD Ameritrade. All you have to do is sign up for an account and you can get it. You do not have to fund the account. It has decent charting and free level 2. You have to enable real time data. I watched a YouTube video that showed me how. It was simple.
07:52 AM
gpkendrickCCNC - that was a serious Rip and Dip. I sold at $3.50 and it went to $5 dammit!
07:52 AM
kissumsimaging buying CCNC at $6.. ouch
07:53 AM
kissumswaiting to see if it can ge back above $3
07:53 AM
benjamins2wKooper59wow that's sounds awesome, thx for the hint
07:53 AM
Kooper59almost time to go for my humanized chinese hamster uterus cell injections.
07:54 AM
gpkendrickNews on KXIN is that there is NO News
07:54 AM
Kooper59benjamins2wTim Lento recommended it. It has scanners, news, charting and other stuff all built in. For FREE it's awesome.
07:54 AM
benjamins2wKooper59I will check it out for sure, thank you
07:55 AM
Kooper59gpkendricki see stuff start spiking and i look for the news. by the time i see there is none i feel like i'm chasing.
07:55 AM
Kooper59once KXIN was past three i gave up.......fortunately.
07:56 AM
gpkendrickKooper59Ive been using AmTrade and TOS for a while now. TOS is a bit complex to learn but it's great for trading. You can get in and out fast. My AmTrade account is linked.
07:56 AM
froggy2371Tim highlighted $MSN yesterday
07:56 AM
amsbeatsCCNC tried to dip buy this a couple times.. made very little. This turd epitomizes the current market conditions
07:57 AM
Kooper59gpkendricki'm using fidelty for trading. i need to fund my ameritrade account.
07:57 AM
amsbeatsbig short squeeze spike followed by infinite death drop with literally ZERO bounce.
07:57 AM
Kooper59my executions on fidelity are fast but it's kind of clunky filling in the ticket
07:57 AM
froggy2371was at .97 and someone drop 50K shares on it now 1.01, wonder if this is gonna take off
07:57 AM
amsbeatsmight as well just take the word bounce out of your vocabulary because it essentailly doesn't exist anymore from what I"m seeing.
07:57 AM
PeterValenciaWas in KXIN on Friday at 2.60 then it went down, held too long and got out -150 . Then it went back up Friday afternoon.... and this morning it goes up past 4 .... Had 500 shares on Friday could've made about 700 if I held until this morning...
07:58 AM
Kooper59i've been bouncing money out of my account that's about it. :P
07:59 AM

08:06 AM
louiedecaro31CCNC must be straight pup I see no news on this thing pumpers did their job on that one what a crazy play too watch first thing pre market just goes to show if you buy pre market be be ready to take profits right away but pre market has been booming lately.
08:07 AM
PatrickRobertsonit just dropped from like 4 dollars to 3.10 in a few seconds too risky
08:08 AM

PraveencnKooper59if you are on TOS try using bracket orders. When i'm dip buying it auto sells at a 1.5% drop, though i do need to increse this to 2.5% since i get knocked off a lot.

Kooper59i think i can bracket but not during premarket or post.
08:01 AM
Kooper59i've never tried it
08:02 AM
PraveencnKooper59maybe they have the same feature. for me it takes out the wishing and hoping and locks in a max loss when i enter the trade. I get to move it around a bit up or down but thats it. Until i get better at catching the falling knife i use this..

12:01 AM
Edw1nibuffyour damm right

noshbariaEdw1nI would, will benefit in the long run...
12:02 AM
noshbariaibuffYep... perfectly mentioned
12:04 AM
ibuffafter pouring through all the dvd's and webinars i think a great idea is to find a trade buddy, someone you can bounce your picks off of
12:07 AM
noshbariaibuffI won't mind sharing my market list but please note I am on the learning curve myself so thread carefully please... Private messaging you...
12:07 AM
ibuffthats what is great about this portal, you are never alone, you can throw out your questions if you ever have a doubt
12:08 AM
Edw1nibuffyeah that's true
12:09 AM
ibuffi went from being an institutional investor to buying what is moving at that single minute, its a crazy game
12:09 AM
Edw1nhaving someone helping each other things will be less hard than they are when you trying to figure out something by ourselves
12:11 AM
noshbariaibuffSorry cannot private message due to restrictions... still learning as I mentioned
12:12 AM
ibuffthe challenge also lets you watch the most successful traders thought process

01:05 AM
chutit is expensive.. heaps of videos on youtube where you can learn because they show entry and exit points
01:59 AM
PatrickRobertsonIs STT working for everyone, today I opened it up and nothing comes up when I do a scan. I can only pull up a chart if I know the ticker
02:24 AM
BabsAlviePatrickRobertsonHi.. not sure, since yesterday was Saturday if anything normally shows on Sunday??
04:33 AM
Gerg40517GM all, lots of studying this weekend, lets see how much i screw up today lol
04:33 AM
thinkeGM, hopefully not too much
04:34 AM
Gerg40517its stubborn habits that get me and i know it, that's the rough part lol
04:36 AM
thinkeYeah me too, patience, chasing, fomoing
04:39 AM
Gerg40517your not alone!
04:39 AM
AleksanderJGM. Excactly the same happening here. Bad entries and exits on good potential trades. And I ALWAYS know what I did wrong after the fact
04:40 AM
JRodAR83Same! Why are we so stubborn.... LOL
04:41 AM
Gerg40517hindsight is 20/20, That's why i am committing to posting it all and hopefully learning from those mistakes
04:41 AM
IvanPGerg40517just trade very carefully :) I somehow managed not to blow up my account in the first months of trading, so I think anybody can manage, too. The key is to experiment with small amounts and not to rise your bets until you are certain of what you're doing and your profits are consistent :) I know, that's a nice theory. We just need to practice and watch
04:42 AM
Gerg40517increase the knowledge account, i have to look at that as a profit in itself.
04:43 AM
AleksanderJYeah, trading carefully is key. I personally trade with 1/6 of 1% on each trade. So it will take time to blow up :)
04:44 AM
IvanPas I watched other bleed because the were increasing their bets after losing couple of trades, I did the opposite: whenever I lost, I decreased the bets. After couple of wins, I increased them. The easy key is, never bet more than 5% of your account. If you're winning, account is growing, and 5% of your account is also growing - so you can bet more. And vice versa
04:45 AM
JRodAR83Down to 700 out of 5k and starting to finally understand and now its hard to make $$ with so little and the $10 fee for the trades..
04:47 AM
AleksanderJYeah, that's the problem for most. When you finally learn to trade, the account is almost gone. That's the problem with going in with size in the beginning
04:49 AM
Gerg40517Thankful for this chat and the lessons, it has me only going roughly .05% of my account on any trade, cutting my losses(most of the time, still have that "oh it will bounce mentality at times) and went from thinking i was a knowledgeable investor with stash to realizing i didn't know shit!!!

Kooper59wow that sucked. i bought 200 shares of LIZI at 3.80 and tried to sell at 4.80 and when i hit the sell button it just sat there and spun. i had to reboot and by the time i was able to make the trade it was at 4.40. i still profited $120 but that could have been ugly.

08:16 AM
Lpena1214Gedas2020like technical analysis or just candlesticks
08:16 AM
NotaRussianSpyhirsthollowayYup! I honestly prefer STT news scans, as I find them to do better scans, but the platform still has other issues that TD usually doesn't (such as servers side)
08:17 AM

08:19 AM
hirsthollowayNotaRussianSpyYeah, my STT has been crashing lately... overall do you like TD? I haven't tried many other brokers so idk but i feel like my OTC executions at TD suck
08:19 AM
NotaRussianSpy$GNUS pushed the @sk above 1.45 resistance. This is the indicator which confirms likely morning spike.
08:19 AM
Kooper59NotaRussianSpywhere is this news scanner you speak of?

08:29 AM
NotaRussianSpyBeckdanI can't be bothered to find out either way, as I don't plan to invest or short to 0. But I love slow, multi day breakouts on patterns that usually take minutes. Much safer especially when Ark Invest bought a good chunk of them.
08:29 AM
BeckdanNotaRussianSpyCan't disagree with that logic.
08:32 AM
danyamohrNotaRussianSpyWKHS panic seems to be due to the news on the $200M financing. Tomorrow is the USPS announcement. Should be an interesting day today...

07:27 AM
Kooper59Tbone18that's why i haven't gotten it. my current pc's won't support it
07:27 AM
IvanPTbone18I sent a question to STT support, and they only told me, that some sources calculate float and some use SEC fillings and that STT uses SEC fillings. But, I showed them an example, where STT showed a different number that IB, finviz, yahoo and marketwatch at the same time (and these 4 showed the same number). So ...
07:28 AM
IvanPKooper59they've improved performance, now it's doing OK, I can run both STT and IB (and other sw) at the same time on my laptop and it's not overheating

I see it there, but I'm not watching that small window all the time ... why the hell there is no alerting there (a sound). There is only alert in Top% gainers, when there is a new headline on a ticker in the list, but MDGS wasn't in the list, yet, so no alert. omg

BeckdanSomeone took all the EARS shares at Centerpoint pretty early today. I have been trying all morning with now luck after about 3:30 AM. I managed to get 4K, but didn't get short until 1.60 on the downside because it was crazy earlier. Trying to be patient with the short and ride it all the way down.

08:53 AM
Travis_RiosTimLentoWould it be fair to say that a midday gapper should be treated somewhat like a premarket gapper, and that golden hour is similar to market open in its behavior toward these gappers (Such as $SURF spiking at 11:30 and then running around 2pm yesterday)? Sorry for maybe a dumb question, but I tend to learn better through comparison/analogy....
08:54 AM

04:40 AM
IvanPyes, but wait for 7am, 8am, 9am. It could be a runner again
04:41 AM
IvanPit spiked from 7.50 to 10 on low volume, let's see what it does with the high volume :)
04:43 AM
thinkeIvanPyou r the true, pm moderator, so buy the dip ?, news is fluffy, but it's an former runner
04:47 AM
IvanPI'm not :) I'm just learning, I'm only saying my opinions, you can correct me if I'm wrong. But SPI was a supernova spiker recently on similar news, so there are good odds it can spike again. But it does not have to, it's just a theory. Remember what Tim says - we need to react to what's happening. And never try to predict. Hence, I'd wait for the volume and price action (7am, 8am, 9am). If it doesn't spike, fuck it :)
04:48 AM
IvanPAnd I'm so early here only because I'm in London - 4am eastern equals 9am GMT :)
04:50 AM
IvanPand I like pre-market spikers, because it's not so fast as at market hours and it usually does not drop so fast - you have time to react (cut loses quickly). I've already made 1 trade this morning and I made a small profit even after making a mistake and buying for ASK (1.47) instead of buying for BID (1.37) - wrong button :D It still spiked a little, slowly, then it slowly fade out, so there was plenty of time to sell.

04:52 AM
AleksanderJI was looking at it before it spiked, but since I didn't see any catalyst, I thought it would spike and fail

IvanPsome people that miss the first spike, trade it the next day. or maybe there's a pattern that people follow (as I said before, after hours spiker that ends strong, spiking in the morning) and they follow it. Or maybe, few people started trading it, caused the small gap up and then bots were triggered and bought it too. Hard to say
04:54 AM
thinkeyeah momentum is kept through the night
04:55 AM

04:57 AM
IvanPyes, looks like it bounced from 8.5, but I'd wait for volume
04:59 AM
IvanP7.2 looks to be this week's support, so it sounds like a reasonable risk given the positive news and hot sector. Just thinking loud ...

IvanPthinkevery nice, you must have been quick
05:07 AM
thinkeIvanPWhere do you get this news so fast STT?
05:08 AM
IvanPSTT news scanner - just click on the eye, then custom news scan, create new and then filter what you're interested in, like price below 15, volume 1000, %change 1 or so.
05:08 AM
IvanPBut I'm considering getting some other news source too (TOS or Benzinga)
05:10 AM
IvanPThe problem is (and I can't get it), there is no alert on this news scanner .... why anyone implements a news scanner without and alert? But, you can set up alert in Top%gainers window on a Headline. So if any of the ticker in top % gainers got news, you're alerted. Problem is, the window is empty in the morning and you want to be alerted before the stock spikes, when the news got out ...

Kooper59good morning folks
06:22 AM
Kooper59IvanPTim Lento always links "Scanz"
06:23 AM
Kooper59https://scanz.com/pricing/
06:23 AM
IvanPYes, scanz, TOS, equityfeed, benzinga are the most common (news and scanners)
06:24 AM
Kooper59i haven't looked in to it. we have our house tore to hell. contractors are giving us grief. once that's finished i plan to get a new computer and get set up properly. right now i'm using an i3 lappy connected to my 60" tv
06:25 AM
Kooper59i use fidelity ATP and ToS and my machine bogs. it croaked in the middle of a trade the other day but fortunately i escaped with a small profit.
06:25 AM
IvanPI think benzinga is 99/mo, the basic one, not sure if both news and scanners are included, but news definitely
06:25 AM
IvanPah, so you're saying, another news feed will eat your laptop resources?
06:26 AM
Kooper59i'm pretty sure it would. i keep getting out of memory errors on ToS
06:26 AM
Kooper59i need to build a good machine and buy a few proper monitors. then i was planning to get STT.
06:27 AM
Kooper59i'm considering joining @evolvedtrader's program
06:27 AM
Kooper59i think it's a little slower moving and less pressure
06:27 AM
Kooper59i ate it hard yesterday on MDRR
06:28 AM
Kooper59i was sizing up on that second run up. was in for about 2000 shares at one point and it dropped over a dollar in a minute. it was dropping so fast i couldn't catch it until i was in the red for $800
06:28 AM
IvanPnow how do I decide between scanz and benzinga? :)
06:28 AM
IvanPyeah me too, MDRR's a bitch
06:29 AM
Kooper59there was good strength and volume going up and i don't see how anyone could have predicted a million shares sold all at once.
06:29 AM
Kooper59it must have been a programmed trade or something. i thought i was following the rules.
06:29 AM
IvanPyou can't predict that. Couple of days ago, Tim was also caught on a big drop
06:30 AM
Kooper59where you from Ivan?
06:30 AM
IvanPI know Tim doesn't like it (and doesn't use it), but I'm considering to start using stop losses. I think his arguments don't hold any more, there are pretty smart algorithms there and if you set it up right, it will definitely be executed
06:31 AM
IvanPI'm in London (living and working), but I'm from Slovakia
06:31 AM
Kooper59i really need to learn more. i'd like to have hotkeys to sell.
06:31 AM
Kooper59i love fidelity and Active Trader Pro but the way i'm doing it seems a little clunky
06:31 AM
IvanPthat's what I'm considering too :) Again, Tim's argument against hotkeys is overtrading
06:32 AM
Kooper59the drop yesterday was too fast. a hotkey may have saved me but maybe not. it was sooo fast it looked like a late print
06:33 AM
Kooper59we visited the czech republic two years ago
06:33 AM
IvanPhow much was it percentwise for you? I lost 10% on that trade
06:33 AM
IvanPbut it's also because I tried to add on dip buy and it kept falling. I should have sold and then wait for the dip
06:34 AM
Kooper59i don't even know.
06:34 AM
IvanPone candle (1m) usually does not drop more than 5%-10%, so you should have enough time, but I think you need to sell for MIDPRICE to get executed
06:34 AM
Kooper59about 10%
06:35 AM
Kooper59i was four cents from an exitt
06:35 AM
IvanPI put all my trades in excel and one of the column is % PnL before and after commissions
06:35 AM
Kooper59i was going to exit at 4.80
06:35 AM
Kooper59i'm old
06:35 AM
IvanPsometimes %PnL is a profit before commissions and a loss after, scalping is not profitable :)

AleksanderJ61 years old. If you can get a hang of this, then at least you have some income after retirement, unlike most people. I'm 33 and I expect the pension fund to be gone by the time I retire
06:38 AM

07:16 AM
IvanPjamesriverajrnote the 7 indicators Tim recommends to watch. For me, definitely the catalyst (strong/weak), chart history (does is spike and drops, or does it keep strong for some time and respike?), risk/reward - stocks already 200% up are risky (can suddenly drop, see MDRR yesterday), volume (very important, it's best to trade top 10 day-volume stocks), price action - dip buying? catching the spike?
07:16 AM
IvanPand also the overall market (index indicators like SPY, DIA, QQQ)
07:17 AM
IvanPThat's pretty much the basics, I would say

06:56 AM
DTS86lol, well i start at 4am eastern with the rest of em
06:57 AM
INFINITYIvanPAt least by what I've seen. Do you like IB?
06:58 AM
IvanPhave you tried investopedia? https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premarket.asp "Several direct-access brokers allow access to pre-market trading to commence as early at 4:00 a.m. EST from Monday through Friday."
06:58 AM
INFINITYIvanPI wonder if etrade will allow if requested.
06:59 AM
IvanPI like IB in a way ... a can imagine a better way of placing orders. For last couple of days I screw up couple of orders because of this GUI. Still trying to find a faster and more reliable way to place orders
06:59 AM
RickyWhiteEtrade starts at 7am.. Only broker I know that starts before is WeBull starts at 4am
06:59 AM
louiedecaro31thinkeDoes double top mean as much pre market when the volume hasn't reached full potential? just curious on peoples thoughts with that?
06:59 AM
IvanPYes, I think Etrade does not allow 4am trading ..., but there are more brokers than IB that allow it
07:01 AM
C_ShellGood Morning people
07:01 AM
INFINITYIvanPMy current settings allow 7am. I will have to call them. I'm up early anyway, and so much activity in the pre-market these days. Used to be, PR's come out at 9ish, now pre-market is the new playing feild.

MichaelGoode$HTZ on the margin this is beneficial to the company to get a DIP loan but it isn't surprising -- DIP loans are superior to all existing loans and are very low risk to the lenders. This does on net increase the company's indebtedness which will make it less likely for shareholders to get anything at the end of bankruptcy

MichaelGoode$NAV +20% $42.65 $4.1 billion mkt cap Traton close to acquiring Navistar for $44.50 per share, CNBC reports -- Volkswagen's (VWAGY) Traton and Navistar (NAV) are very close to a deal for Traton to acquire what it does not own of the Navistar for $44.50 per share, CNBC's David Faber report, citing people close to the negotiations. Carl Icahn and Mark Rachesky are supporting deal, which still needs formal approval, but has been agreed to verbally, Faber adds.
09:13 AM
MichaelGoode$NAV of course best to ignore it because it is a buyout
09:14 AM
NotaRussianSpyBeckdanAh, well i can only recommend acquiring a long perspective on $HTZ, if only to aid you in finding a better shorting opportunity. As I am doing the reverse for going long :)

09:17 AM
NotaRussianSpyIf $GNUS holds 1.40 today, I will look to enter for a speculative hold play, which I should have done when I anticipated the dip into the 1.30's. Oh well, a few pennies won't hurt :P
