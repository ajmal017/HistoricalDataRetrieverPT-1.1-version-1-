aumphreyHelp give me some words of wisdom to keep at this after my worst week of trading yet (today contributing to nearly half of my losses on the week). I'm over trading and when I get down I can't help but feel like I kind grind it out to get back what was lost. I lost $6,713.83 this week (over $3,000+ lost today mostly from two stupid trades MARP and VVPR on those massive drops). Actually it feels better just to type out this reflection and admit that I sucked this week. However, my wins to lo

04:44 PM
BeckdanaumphreyVVPR was a good trade on the big run up. Kind of gambling on it other than that. Buy it when the squeeze is starting and ride it for a while. Don't get greedy on those run ups. MARP was just BS. Probably a chatroom running it up. Don't trade things without news and a reason to either be long or short.
04:45 PM
Abeeeeaumphreyim there with you. I dont have a massive loss but i just can't let myself go for being stubborn and can't control my emotion
04:46 PM
PoohaumphreyI've been/am in in the exact same boat. I had enough of losing - so i'm sticking to small size and 3 specific patterns that I know well. It's making a huge difference, i'm not revenge trading, or trading to make up my losses. I capture everything I did wrong, analysed, and have made corrections as best I could. Still early days, but suddenly making 5/10%+ gains now and focussing on that - also cutting losses much quicker.
04:48 PM
AbeeeePoohim thinking just use my cash account instead of margin so i can cut loss quicker and don't feel like i waste a day trade. Hopefully it will help me to make my decision better
04:51 PM
AcetradeaumphreyWhen you trade, what is your goal? A certain dollar amount? A big win? I'm really close to getting over the PDT amount on my account, with a 78% win rate in September. What helped me was deciding that all I wanted to do was win the trade. I don't care how small...just win the trade. I had a great week on day trades and swing trades, with a couple OTC overnight wins. My point is this: when we focus on winning the trade (regardless of money made), we release ourselves from FOMO and broken tr
04:51 PM
PoohaumphreyGood idea. When I got over PDT - I made 90% of my losses as I could suddenly short, and trade as much as I want. Lesson learnt. I now plan out what I am doing, set risk, set goal, and only enter according to my plan otherwise i rather miss out on the play. I've set my mind to only trade if absolutely needed, and not because i'm bored / make my self believe there is a play.
04:52 PM
aumphreyThanks all! Of course, I am certainly learning from all these trades wins and losses. Just needed a little encouragement. I should have stayed out of VVPR after the big run up. I timed the first and second trades perfectly getting out just before the halts and was up $230 but then just had to get back in thinking it would run up more and BOOM found myself averaging down because I erased all earlier profits and more...eventually found myself down $1,600 on that trade. 6 months ago me would
04:52 PM
Acetrade...broken trading habits. Just win, baby, just win. Obsess over small wins. It may help adjust your mindest.
04:57 PM
aumphreyAcetradeGod points! I have found myself thinking that way on some day when trading especially after a really bad day (like this upcoming Monday for instance...I will be trading that way LOL). I am currently winning at a rate of around 70% but those losses for me are just bigger than the small gains. However, I have gotten better at taking smaller losses and being ok with losing. Every once in awhile like maybe less than 5% of the time I lose BIG just because I believe the stock will keep going or th

kermike33aumphreyI lost 6K in one day, which put me back into the PDT rule. I learned many things in the past few months by slowing down, and not overtrading. Picking the best trades has helped my discipline, and I find I'm happier then when I could trade as much as I wanted. I get Frustrated at the things I don't know, but So far, as I have humbled myself and applied what Tim says...it's working. I have enough money to overcome the PDT rule, but choose to limit myself till I see more consistent behavior/wins

05:22 PM
spacefaceaumphreyDon't let the mistakes get you down. Pretty much every successful trader has bad weeks from time to time, and lots of them at first. Sucks losing money but there are endless opportunities ahead so think of it as paying for an education that will pay you back multiples over time. Maybe size down next week until you get things dialed in. Also be careful with averaging down. Know when to cut yourself off

kobyoshiaumphreyI agree. I lost a couple and then sized down and really was picky about what I bought this week and I won 3 in a row with smaller positions just to get back into the groove
